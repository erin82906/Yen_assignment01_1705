                    <li><b>Step 1:</b>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 2 minutes. Rinse eggs in cold water and cool to room temperature; peel.</li><br><br>
                    <li><b>Step 2:</b>Combine rice vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Let cool.</li><br><br>
                    <li><b>Step 3:</b>Prepare batter by adding red and yellow food coloring to the water to get a deep orange color. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl; pour in orange water and stir until there are no lumps.</li><br><br>
                    <li><b>Step 4:</b>Heat oil in a wok to 375 degrees F <b>(190 degrees C).</b></li><br><br>
                    <li><b>Step 5:</b>Gently roll eggs in cornstarch to coat and shake off excess cornstarch. Dip into orange batter so they are fully covered. Poke eggs with the bamboo skewer and drop gently into the hot oil. Deep fry until the batter is crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li><br><br><br>

                     <li><b>Step 1:</b>Flatten the chicken thighs out by lightly bashing them between two pieces of baking parchment with a rolling pin, then put in a sealable container with the garlic, paprika, chilli, ginger and a pinch of salt. Massage the mix into the meat, then chill until ready to cook for at least 1 hr or up to 24 hrs.</li><br><br>
                     <li><b>Step 2:</b>To pickle the cabbage, put the vinegar, sugar, coriander seeds and turmeric in a pan and bring to the boil to dissolve the sugar. Take off the heat and stir in the shredded cabbage, ensuring itâ€™s completely immersed in the liquid. Cover and leave to cool.</li><br><br>
                     <li><b>Step 3:</b>For the relish, sprinkle the cucumber with a little salt and leave for 10 mins. Squeeze out the liquid, then stir the cucumber through the mayo and lime juice and set aside. For the glaze, mix the mustard and sriracha together in a separate bowl.</li><br><br>
                     <li><b>Step 4:</b>Heat a barbecue to medium or the grill to its highest setting. Barbecue or grill the chicken for 5 mins on one side, then flip and continue to cook, brushing with the glaze a few times until sticky, glossy and cooked through. Toast the buns, spoon some cabbage onto the base, place the chicken on top, then dollop a generous amount of the cooling cucumber relish over the chicken before closing the buns and serving.</li><br><br><br>
